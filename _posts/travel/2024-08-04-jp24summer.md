<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Air thick as molasses</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Ahhh I love Japan... enough to torture myself in the excruitiating heat of Japan's viscous summer air.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">As with any Japan trip I've been on, Tokyo and Kyoto were steadfastly present on the itinerary. This time though, we thought to venture into Osaka for once. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Pacing ourselves in the extreme heat, the most memorable moment by far came when we least expected. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">tldr; we went to a run down restaurant manned by an old granny and had the best food of our lives.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In suburban Kyoto, on our way to Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple, we were due for lunch. Google Maps and its restaurant ratings have always been the tried and true source for yummy restaurants. It was no different for "Jurakuan", 4.7 stars, 100+ reviews.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In the still stifling heat, the restaurant entrance looked rather abandoned, covered in unkempt shrubbery, leading to a crumbling home with an eclectic array of kitchen and home items overflowing inside. At this point, we thought seriously about leaving, but we were too hungry and had few options, so we chose to bite the bullet as a hunched, kind granny came to serve us.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">She was the only one there to serve and we were the only ones there to be served. After we had ordered, we sat cross-legged on the floor scrutinising the holes in the wall and the slightly disturbing newspaper articles on display. We waited patiently as a fly buzzed around keeping us company whilst the granny tinkered with her pots and pans - this was like a Ghibli film but not romantic.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Before long, we were served our udon and soba noodles served in clear ice cold broth with generous fillets of fish. In all honesty, we weren't expecting the best, but in one bite I could taste the unimaginable experience this grandma had accrued over her life making bowls of noodles and gobbled down the rest. This was one of the best meals of the trip.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I guess one lesson is the age old "don't judge a book by its cover," but I've always had a soft spot for grandmothers, I feel like they've lived such a selfless life and I just want to give back. Okini!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">So Japan again when? Said no Aussie traveller ever.</p>
