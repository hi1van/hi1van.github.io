<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Long awaited return to roots</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It's been almost a decade since I had last returned to the "motherland" and hence I was eager to see the China of today. I usually visit Shenzhen for family, but this was my first time in the Shanghai region.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Shanghai has always been on my bucket list for the iconic mega-metropolis that it is... but really mainly for the shengjianbao. Another two cities on my travel hunt were Suzhou and Hangzhou; there is a saying, “上有天堂，下有苏杭,” meaning, “Just as there is paradise in heaven, there are Suzhou and Hangzhou on earth.” I feel this served the perfect introduction to China as you witness the vastness and ingenuity of modern China, alongside the contrasting antique beauty of China past. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 60px;"> To wrap up the trip, I had a lovely time reconnecting with family in Shenzhen after having been so long. With lots of yumcha in my belly, I speedran through Hong Kong before I was soon on my flight headed home.</p>
