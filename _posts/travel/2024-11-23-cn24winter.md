<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Long awaited return to roots</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It was almost a decade since I had returned to the supposed "motherland." Thus, I kept a keen eye to see what China is all about and how she has developed since I had seen her last.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Shanghai has always been on my bucket list for the mega metropolis bursting at the seams it is, but mainly for its shengjianbao. Another two cities on my hunt were Suzhou and Hangzhou as “上有天堂，下有苏杭,” meaning, “Just as there is paradise in heaven, there are Suzhou and Hangzhou on earth.” I feel this is the perfect introduction to China as you witness the vastness and ingenuity of modern China, and contrastingly, the antique beauty of China past. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Shenzhen and Hong Kong were places I found myself next. To be honest, there isn't much to say but it was lovely reconnecting with family over lots of yumcha.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">...I feel like I haven't emphasised the tables of food which I had enough, but I am indeed in need of gym.</p>
