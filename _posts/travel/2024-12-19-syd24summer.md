<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Summertime serenity - Merry Christmas and bring on the new year</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Made the trek up to Sydney for a friend's 21st, but extended our stay to make a trip out of it - so it was, once again, Melbourne boys (and girl) take on Sydney for what must be the billionth time.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Being the "billionth time," we had little desire to visit each famed Sydney attraction, instead taking a more ad hoc and relaxed approach to travelling - one with little agenda.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">This was the cherry on top to a humbling year. Bring on the next!</p>
