<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Summertime serenity - Merry Christmas and bring on the new year</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Made the trek up to Sydney for a friend's 21st, but extended our stay to make a trip out of it - so it was, once again, Melbourne boys (and girl) take on Sydney for what must be the billionth time.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Being the "billionth time," we had little desire to visit each famed Sydney attraction, instead taking a more ad hoc and relaxed approach to travelling - one with little agenda.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Experiencing Sydney like this made me realise just how similar it is to Melbourne. Although this may be starting to read as a Melburnian writing with an inferiority complex toward Sydney, once you move past Sydney's beautiful harbour scenes and its warm beaches, they're much the same. Only the the mega wealthy can experience the harbour the way you romanticise it, but anyway, I digress.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">Everything considered, this was the cherry on top to a humbling year. Bring on the next!</p>
